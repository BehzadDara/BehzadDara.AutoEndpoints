## Overview

`BehzadDara.AutoEndpoints` is a lightweight library designed to simplify the creation of endpoints for enumerations in .NET applications. By using custom attributes, this library automatically generates endpoints that return a list of enum values, making it easier to work with enums in your APIs.

## Features

- Automatically generates endpoints for enums with the specified route.
- Allows additional information to be added to enum fields using custom attributes.
- Simplifies the process of exposing enum values through your API.

## Usage

To use this library, define your enums and annotate them with the `EnumEndpointAttribute`. Additionally, you can use the `InfoAttribute` to provide extra information for each enum field.
